## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The Proposed Waste Management App is a comprehensive and easy-to-use interface that aims to eliminate the hassle associated with proper, efficient waste disposal. Our App will deploy an object detection model that will be able to easily detect all the different waste objects, compile them into a list, and classify them automatically into their disposal categories. It also aims to simplify and automate many different aspects of waste management.
## Why we chose this idea ?
The idea for the Waste Management and Sustainability App stems from the urgent need to address environmental concerns and promote responsible waste management practices. With the increasing challenges of overflowing landfills, pollution, and climate change, this app serves as a powerful tool to empower individuals and communities to make a positive impact. It combines educational resources, user-friendly features, gamification, and easy automation to motivate and guide users in adopting eco-friendly habits.
## APPROACH 
 ### 1.Virtual Trash Audit
 Allows users to upload a photo of their waste bin for detection, analysis, classification and and listing of all the different wastes to be disposed off. 
 ### 2.Waste Pickup Requests
 Integrates a feature that lets users schedule special pickups for large items or hazardous waste that can't be disposed of through regular channels. 
 ### 3.Personalized Reminders
 Allows users to set up personalized reminders for garbage collection days and specific waste sorting schedules to ensure they never miss a collection day. 
 ### 4.Interactive Maps
 Provides users with interactive maps displaying nearby recycling centers, composting facilities, and donation centers to facilitate responsible disposal.
 ### 5.Donation Matching
 Partners with local charities or organizations to match users' unwanted items with donation requests, ensuring items are reused before being discarded.
 
 ## TECH STACK 
* Firebase
* TFLite
* Kotlin & XML
* Mapbox
* Cloudinary
* PyTorch
* pandas
  
## Brief Implementation details
* The App will be coded natively in Kotlin using
Android Studio as the IDE.
* The front-end will be done using digital
design tools for UI design such as FIGMA and
create XML layouts.
* The App authentication and database
handling will be handled using the Firebase
Realtime Database and Authentication.
* The uploaded images will be stored and
displayed using Cloudinary.
* The waste detection and classification
algorithm will be based on a GitHub Library:
detect-waste by AgaMiko. It will be modified
and retrained to suit our purposes.
* The ML model recieved will be in PyTorch
framework which cannot be easily
implemented. So this will be converted to a
.tflite model and then implemented directly
into our app.
* The beautiful interactive dynamic maps will be done
using the MapBox SDK.
* Social media messages and sharing will be
implemented directly via intent launchers.
* A comprehensive notification and alarm system will
be created using Android's inbuilt Notification
Manager.
* The Alert System and the Scheduling of waste
Pickups and classifications will be done via FireBase.
 

# Market Adaptability

The demand for our app will be high due to the
increasing environmental awareness, regulatory
changes, convenience, community engagement,
and practical benefits it offers in daily waste
management.
App usage may include partnerships with local
waste management agencies, incentives for user
referrals, and proactive marketing to raise
awareness about the app's benefits.
The app's user-friendly interface, convenience,
and gamified elements make it a valuable tool for
users, leading to their appreciation and active
usage.

# Market Feasibility

* The increasing global focus on sustainability and
eco-friendly practices creates a favorable market
environment for your Waste Management and
Sustainability Mobile App.
* Regulatory changes and government initiatives
promoting responsible waste management provide
a strong market opportunity for an app that helps
users adhere to these regulations.
* The demand for user-friendly tools that simplify
waste sorting, offer reminders, and provide
incentives for sustainable living is growing, making
your app highly relevant to consumers.
* The app's community challenges and social
sharing features tap into the desire for community
involvement, driving market feasibility as users
seek to make a positive impact together.

# Use Cases

* Individuals can use the app for personal waste
management, accessing waste sorting guidance,
reminders, and gamification features to enhance their
eco-conscious living.
* The app can become a daily necessity by simplifying
the waste classification and waste disposal process
exponentially.
* Families can use the app to coordinate waste
management efforts and reminders for multiple
household members.
* Environmental organizations can promote the app to
encourage responsible waste management and
engage with their members to drive sustainability
initiatives.
